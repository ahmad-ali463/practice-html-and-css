        <div>
            <h4 class="aa">"Democracy is the government of the pepole for the people and by the people"</h4>

            <p>Representative democarcy involve the selection of government officals by the people being represented.
                The most common system involve the election of the candidates with a majority vote. pakistan is a democratic and islamic country but democracy in pakistan has been irregular and unstaisfactory. the principle of democarcy is equality ,freedom and social justice when are unfortunately not being fully enjoyed by the people.the reason is that the dictator never allow to principle of democarcy to flourish to our country.
            </p>
<h4 class="aa">When people fear the government there is tyranny, when the government fears the people, there is liberty.</h4>
<p>The existence of fedual system  contorl lives millions of villagers and farmers. The uneducated people will countinue the vote for lords and will always to illrate backward and down tordden. The members of elected national and provincial assemblies are big guns. Their own benefit keep the country downwards. The big industrailist also jump to politics to share political and commerical benefit with their "jagirdars" brothers. The jigardiars and industrailist have always joined hand with their miltary dictators. The result is that pakistan has an history of martial laws and dictatorial democracies. </p>
<p>Our top political leader, minister, chief minister, prime minister and president have been coming from upper classes. They do not understand layman beacause they do not required ability and vision. they are reasposible for martial-laws. Democracy cannnot flourish in the country in the absence of suitable leader.</p>
